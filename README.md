## About FloBotics

This is my personal digital lab for experimenting with AI-enhanced creativity‚Äîfrom dynamic social content to narrative-driven media and interactive code.

It features [SerialThief.com](https://www.serialthief.com/), a sci-fi podcast and story-driven game where a time-traveling thief atones for her past by correcting historical injustices. Each chapter includes AI-generated visuals, voice cloning, and interactive video prompts to immerse the audience in branching narratives and redemption arcs.

In addition to creative projects, I occasionally explore:
- Prompt engineering for AI art and video generation
- Voice cloning workflows for character building
- Python-coded mini-games embedded in narrative sites
- Experiments in generative storytelling and emotional pacing
